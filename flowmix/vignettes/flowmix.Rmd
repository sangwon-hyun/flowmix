# Introduction

`flowmix` is an R package containing code for analyzing flow cytometry data
using the "flowmix" model -- a sparse constrained multivariate mixture of
regressions model. this model is appropriate to use when you have a collection
of flow cytometry datasets $y^{(t)}$ *and* p-variate *covariates* $X^{(t)} \in
\R^p$ -- more about this notation and setup is shown below in the "Model"
section.


The original paper can be found here:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11251
(Accepted to the Annals of Applied Statistics).

# Installation 

Simple installation instructions go here.

# Model

**Basic model.** Consider response data $y^{(t)}$ and covariate $X^{(t)} \in
\R^{p}$ observed over time $t = 1,\cdots, T$.

In our setup, $y^{(t)}$ is a collection of $n_t$ $d$-variate data points
$y_i^{(t)}$. Because our main application is flow cytometry which measures
cell-level attributes in a fluid, we will call these particles, and $y^{(t)}$
cytograms.

Now, conditional on covariate $X^{(t)}$ at time $t$, each particle is modeled to
come from a probabilistic mixture of $K$ different d-variate Gaussians:

$$y^{(t)}_i | X^{(t)} \sim \cN_d \left(\mu_{kt}, \Sigma_k\right)
  \text{ with probability } \pi_{kt},$$

where $\pi_{kt}$ is the $k$'th cluster's relative abundance at time $t$, and
$\mu_{kt}$ is the $k$'th cluster center at time $t$.

For each $k=1,\cdots, K$, cluster centers $\mu_{kt} \in \R^d$ and cluster
probabilities $\pi_{kt}$ at time $t$ are modeled as functions of $X^{(t)}$:

$$\mu_{kt} = \beta_{0k} + \beta_k^T X^{(t)}$$

and

$$\pi_{kt} = \frac{\exp(\alpha_{0k} + {X^{(t)}}^T \alpha_k)}{\sum_{l=1}^K \exp(\alpha_{0l} + {X^{(t)}}^T \alpha_l)}$$

for regression coefficients $\beta_{0k} \in \R^d$, $\beta_{k} \in \R^{p \times
d}$, $\alpha_k \in \R^p$, and $\alpha_{0k} \in \R$ The covariance
$\Sigma_k$ determines shape of $k$'th Gaussian cluster, and is assumed to be
constant over time, and not determined by covariates.

<!-- ; $\beta$ and $\alpha$ are -->
<!-- used as shorthand for the collection of all coefficients. -->

**Sparse coefficient estimation.** The aforementioned model has $(p+1)(d+1)K$
regression coefficients, which can be large compared to the number of cytograms
$T$. So we penalize the log-likelihood with lasso penalties
\citep{orig-lasso-paper} on $\alpha$ and $\beta$, which induce sparsity on these
coefficients, thus enhancing interpretation and making the model
identifiable. The two regularization parameters are $\lambda_{\alpha}$ and
$\lambda_{\beta}$ govern the level of sparsity, and are estimated using
cross-validation.

**Limiting cluster mean movement.** Also, in our ocean application, each cell
population has a limited range in optical properties, due to biological
constraints. We incorporate this domain knowledge into the model by constraining
the range of $\mu_{k1}, \cdots, \mu_{kT}$ over time. Since $\beta_k^TX^{(t)} =
\mu_{kt} - \beta_{0k}$, limiting the size of $\beta_k^TX^{(t)}$ is equivalent to
limiting the *deviation* of the $k$'th cluster mean at all times $t=1,\cdots,T$
away from the overall center $\beta_{0k}$. Motivated by this, we add a
\textit{hard} constraint so that $\|\beta_k^T X^{(t)}\|_2 \le r$ for some fixed
radius value $r>0$.

The constraint also plays an important role for model interpretability. We wish
for the $k$'th mixture component to correspond to the same cell population over
all time. When a cell population vanishes we would like $\pi_{kt}$ to go to zero
rather than for $\mu_{kt}$ to move to an entirely different place in cytogram
space.

Lastly, the model estimates are obtained using a penalized
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which is optimized to be fast.

For more details about the model and algorithm, please refer to the full paper:
[link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11251).

Next, we use artificial and real data to demonstrate how to use the package. The
main function is `flowmix()`.

# Examples

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(flowmix)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tibble)
library(RColorBrewer)
```


## Artificial data

First, generate data:

```{r generate-data, echo=TRUE}
set.seed(0)
datobj = generate_data_generic(p = 5, TT = 300, fac = .2, nt = 2000, dimdat = 3) #
ylist = datobj$ylist
X = datobj$X
```

This produces three dimensional cytograms `ylist` and covariates `X`.

* `ylist` is a list of length $T=300$, the number of time points (or
  cytograms). Each element of `ylist` is an array with $d=3$ rows (a single
  cytogram) and $n_t$ columns. The number of columns $n_t$ of each element in
  `ylist` can be different.

* `X` is a $T \times p$ matrix, whose $t$'th rows contain the relevant
  (environmental) covariates of the $t$'th cytogram.

The first cytogram $y^{(1)}$ looks like this (only plotting the first two
dimensions, out of three).

```{r viz-one-cytogram, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
y = ylist[[1]][,1:2]
colnames(y) = c("dim1", "dim2")
as_tibble(y) %>%
  ggplot() + geom_point(aes(x=dim1, y = dim2), alpha = .3) +
  coord_fixed()
```

Especially if your data is a time series, it could be useful to plot the
covariates $X^{(t)}$ once across time $t=1,\cdots, T$.

```{r viz-covariates, fig.width=10, fig.height=3}
colnames(X) = c("sinewave", "changepoint", "other1", "other2", "other3")
as_tibble(X) %>%
  add_column(time = 1:nrow(X)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = !time)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=time, y=value)) +
  facet_grid(.~name) +
  geom_point()
```

Now, we estimate the data with *fixed* regularization parameters
$\lambda_\alpha=0.01$ and $\lambda_\beta=0.01$, and $K=10$ clusters.

Internally, `flowmix()` repeats the estimation five times (five is the default)
with different random restarts, and returns the estimated model out of five runs
with the best data fit.

```{r fit-model}
numclust = 4
set.seed(0)
res = flowmix(ylist = ylist, X = X, numclust = numclust,
              mean_lambda = 0.001, prob_lambda = 0.001,
              nrep = 1)
print(res)
```


The cluster probabilities over time look like this:

```{r plot-prob, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
prob = res$prob
colnames(prob) = paste0("Cluster", 1:numclust)

as_tibble(prob) %>% 
  add_column(time = 1:nrow(prob)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = !time)  %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=time, y=value)) +
  facet_grid(.~name) +
  geom_line() +
  ylab("Estimated cluster probability")
```

Showing the model estimates across time, in an animation. 

```{r make-gif, animation.hook='ffmpeg', dev='jpeg', interval=0.1, ffmpeg.format="gif", fig.width=10, fig.height=3.3, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
## Make all 2d plots
ylim = c(-3,8)
xlim = c(-5,8)
for(tt in seq(from=1, to = 300, by = 30)){
  plist = lapply(list(c(1,2), c(2,3), c(3,1)), function(dims){

    ## Take the model estimates for dimensions in \code{dims}
    mn = res$mn[tt,dims,]
    sigma = res$sigma[,dims,dims]
    prob = res$prob[tt,]

    ## Plot them in a figure
    y = ylist[[tt]][,dims] 
    varnames = paste0("dim", dims)
    varname1 = varnames[1]
    varname2 = varnames[2]
    colnames(y) = varnames
    y = y %>% as_tibble()
    p = ggplot(y, aes(x = !!sym(varname1), y = !!sym(varname2))) +
      geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
      ylim(ylim) +
      xlim(xlim)

    ## Add model
    p1 = add_model_2d(p, mn, sigma, prob)
    return(p1)
  })
  
  gridExtra::grid.arrange(plist[[1]], plist[[2]], plist[[3]], nrow = 1,
                          top = paste0("t = ", tt, " out of ", res$TT))
}
```


## Cross-validation

`cv.flowmix` conducts cross-validation among the candidate regularization
parameters in numeric vectors `prob_lambdas` and `mean_lambdas`
($\lambda_\alpha$ and $\lambda_\beta$). These can be obtained numerically like
this:

```{r cv, eval = TRUE}
## Define the locations to save the CV results.
destin = "." 

## Define the CV folds (as every fifth, nfold-sized, block of indices)
folds = make_cv_folds(ylist, nfold = 5, blocksize = 20) 

## This saves to a file `maxres.Rdata` under the |destin| directory.
maxres = get_max_lambda(destin,
                        "maxres.Rdata",
                        ylist = ylist,
                        countslist = NULL,
                        X = X,
                        numclust = 4,
                        maxdev = 0.5,
                        max_mean_lambda = 40,
                        max_prob_lambda = 2)

cv_gridsize = 5
prob_lambdas =  logspace(min = 0.0001, max = maxres$alpha, length = cv_gridsize)
mean_lambdas = logspace(min = 0.0001, max = maxres$beta, length = cv_gridsize)
```

```{r remove-maxres-file, eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
file.remove(file = file.path("maxres.Rdata"))
```

Also define the CV folds. You can choose not to, by setting `folds=NULL`, in
which case the default folds are used.

```{r cv-folds}
## Define the CV folds (as every fifth, nfold-sized, block of indices)
folds = make_cv_folds(ylist, nfold = 5, blocksize = 20) 
```

Now, run the cross-validation using `cv.flowmix()`.

```{r cv-main, eval = FALSE}
cvres = cv.flowmix(ylist = ylist,
                   countslist = NULL,
                   X = X,
                   maxdev = 0.5,
                   numclust = 4,
                   prob_lambdas = prob_lambdas,
                   mean_lambdas = mean_lambdas,
                   nrep = 10,
                   folds = folds,
                   destin = destin,
                   mc.cores = 8)
```

(This code takes long, so it's recommended that you run it separately in a
script; use the `mc.cores` option to run the jobs on multiple cores):

The results are saved into separate files whose names follow these rules:
- "1-1-1-1.Rdata" for `ialpha`-`ibeta`-`irep`-`ifold`.Rdata, having run the CV.
- "1-1-1-cvres.Rdata" for having estimated the model in the full data

After the cross-validation is finished, the final selected model is summarized
from these files, and optionally saved to a file `summary.RDS` (if `save=TRUE`):

```{r cv-summary, eval=FALSE}
cvres = cv_summary(destin = destin,
                   cv_gridsize = 5,
                   nrep = 10,
                   nfold = 5,
                   save = TRUE,
                   filename = "summary.RDS")
```

We can see the final model chosen by cross-validation like this:

```{r cv-print, eval=FALSE}
print(cvres$bestres)
```

## Real data

Now, trying this on real (binned) data:

```{r real-data}
## Load data
## datobj = readRDS(file = "~/repos/flowmix/paper-data/MGL1704-hourly-paper.RDS")
datobj = readRDS(file = "../inst/extdata/MGL1704-hourly-paper.RDS") ## change to readRDS(system.file("extdata", "MGL1704-hourly-paper.RDS"))
datobj %>% list2env(envir = .GlobalEnv) %>% invisible()

## Estimate model
set.seed(1)
res = flowmix(ylist, X, numclust = 10,
              countslist = countslist,
              mean_lambda = 0.001,
              prob_lambda = 0.001,
              maxdev = 0.5,
              nrep = 1,
              verbose = FALSE)
```

See the appendix below for more about binning data.

Also, here we have used a fixed, hand-picked pair of regularization parameter
values `mean_lambda` and `prob_lambda`. In practice, you'll want to
cross-validate.

We can visualize the estimated model in several ways. First, the default
`print()` gives a summary about the coefficients' sparseness.

```{r real-print}
print(res)
```

The probabilities in `res$prob` can be visualized as follows.

```{r real-prob-plot, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 6}
numclust = 10
prob = res$prob
colnames(prob) = paste0("Cluster ", 1:numclust)
prob_long = as_tibble(prob) %>% 
  add_column(time = 1:nrow(prob)) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = !time) 
prob_long$name = factor(prob_long$name, paste0("Cluster ", 1:numclust))

prob_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = time, y = value)) +
  facet_wrap(~name, ncol = 5) +
  geom_line() +
  ylab("Estimated cluster probability")
```


Lastly, the model means and 95\% confidence regions in `res$mn` can be
visualized -- two dimensions at a time, overlaid with data -- as follows.

<!-- {r real-gif, animation.hook = 'ffmpeg', dev = jpeg, interval = 0.1, ffmpeg.format = "gif", fig.width = 10, fig.height = 3.3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE} -->

```{r real-data-plot, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 3.3, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dimnames = c("diam", "red", "orange")
## for(tt in seq(from=1, to = 296, by = 10)){
for(tt in c(50,100,150,200)){
  plist = lapply(list(c(1,2), c(2,3), c(3,1)), function(dims){

    ## Take the model estimates for dimensions in \code{dims}
    mn = res$mn[tt,dims,]
    sigma = res$sigma[,dims,dims]
    prob = res$prob[tt,]

    ## Plot them in 2d 
    y = ylist[[tt]][,dims] 
    varnames = dimnames[dims] ##paste0("dim", dims)
    varname1 = varnames[1]
    varname2 = varnames[2]
    colnames(y) = varnames
    y = y %>% as_tibble()
    p = ggplot(y, aes(x = !!sym(varname1), y = !!sym(varname2))) +
      geom_tile(alpha = 0.2) +
      ylim(c(0,8)) +  xlim(c(0,8))

    ## Add model
    p = add_model_2d(p, mn, sigma, prob)
    return(p)
  })
  gridExtra::grid.arrange(plist[[1]], plist[[2]], plist[[3]], nrow = 1,
                          top = paste0("t = ", tt, " out of ", res$TT))
}
```


# Appendix

## Binning data

If the data contains too many particles, it is better to reduce the size of
`ylist` and instead deal with binned counts.

The new object `countslist` can be *additionally* input to `flowmix()`.

Here is an example. `make_grid(ylist, gridsize=30)` makes an equally sized grid
of size 30 from the data range, in each dimension. Then, `bin_many_cytograms()`
places the particles in `ylist` in each of these bins. The resulting object is a
list which contains the grid centers `ybin_list` and the counts in each
`counts_list`.

(It's not demonstrated here, but apart from binning data, another use for
`countslist` is to describe the biomass of each particle.)

```{r bin-data, fig.width = 5}
## Generate synthetic particle-level (non-binned) data
library(flowmix)
set.seed(0)
datobj = generate_data_generic(p = 5, TT = 100, fac = .2, nt = 2000, dimdat = 3)
ylist = datobj$ylist
X = datobj$X
y = ylist %>% .[[1]] %>% as_tibble()
colnames(y) = c("dim1", "dim2", "dim3")

## Plot data before binning
p = ggplot(y) +
  geom_point(aes(x=dim1, y=dim2), alpha = .1, size = rel(1)) +
  coord_fixed()
plot(p)
```

Then, bin the particle-level data using `bin_many_cytograms()`.

```{r do-the-binning}
# TODO: fix this error
## Bin this data
grid = make_grid(ylist, gridsize = 30)
obj = bin_many_cytograms(ylist, grid, mc.cores = 2, verbose=FALSE) # CRAN limits the number of cores to 2  
ylist = obj$ybin_list
countslist = obj$counts_list

ylist[[1]] %>% head(15) %>% round(3) %>% print()
countslist[[1]] %>% head(15) %>% print()
```

Here is what the binned data looks like (focusing on the first two dimensions).

```{r bin-plot, fig.width = 5}
## Just look at one time point
tt = 10
dims = c(1,2)
y = ylist[[tt]]##[,dims] 
counts = countslist[[tt]]

## Collapse the binned 3d data to 2d
y = flowmix::collapse_3d_to_2d(y, counts, dims = 1:2) %>% as_tibble()
y %>% head(15) %>% round(3) %>% print()

## Plot it
varname1 = colnames(y)[1]
varname2 = colnames(y)[2]
colours = c("white", "blue")
p = ggplot(y) +
  geom_tile(aes(x = !!sym(varname1), y = !!sym(varname2), fill = counts)) +
  theme_grey() +
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = colours, guide="colorbar") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  coord_fixed() +
  ggtitle(paste0(tt, " out of ", 100))
plot(p)
```

Now, estimating a model on the binned data: 

```{r bin-model}
## Run the algorithm on binned data
numclust = 4
res = flowmix(ylist = ylist,
              X = X,
              countslist = countslist,
              numclust = numclust,
              mean_lambda = 0.001,
              prob_lambda = 0.001,
              verbose = FALSE,
              maxdev = 0.5)
print(res)
```

And finally overlaying the model on the binned data: 

```{r bin-model-plot, fig.width = 5}
## Add model
mn = res$mn[tt,dims,]
sigma = res$sigma[,dims, dims]
prob = res$prob[tt,]
p = add_model_2d(p, mn, sigma, prob)
plot(p)
```

## EM algorithm = one job

It's useful to understand how the cross-validation is done. The key is to
parallelize into multiple CPU cores on a single computer, or even among many
different computers or servers.

One "job" (using the function `one_job(ialpha, ibeta, ifold, irep)`) is to run
the EM algorithm once, for:

- the `ialpha`-th $\lambda_\alpha$ value (out of `prob_lambdas`).
- the `ibeta`-th $\lambda_\alpha$ value (out of `mean_lambdas`).
- the `ifold`-th test fold out of the `nfold=5` CV folds.
- the `irep`-th repeat of the EM algorithm (`nrep=10` in total)

After each job is run, the result is saved in a file named like
`[ialpha]-[ibeta]-[ifold]-[irep]-cvscore.Rdata`.

The cross-validation is designed to maximally allow for parallel computations.
(Notice how even a normal-sized using a 5-fold cross-validation with 10
restarts, over a 10 x 10 grid of $(\lambda_\alpha, \lambda_\beta)$ takes $6,000$
separate "jobs", or EM algorithm runs). A design that separates each job -- and
saves each result to separate files -- allows the user to parallelize as they
wish, and if necessary, save and restart jobs conveniently.

```{r one-job, eval=FALSE}
## Example of one CV job for one pair of regularization parameters (and CV folds
## and EM replicates)
ialpha = 1
ibeta = 1
ifold = 1
irep = 1
destin = "~/Desktop"## Change to your target destination.
one_job(ialpha = ialpha,
        ibeta = ibeta,
        ifold = ifold,
        irep = irep,
        folds = folds,
        destin = destin,
        mean_lambda = mean_lambdas, prob_lambdas = prob_lambdas,
        ## The rest that is needed explicitly for flowmix()
        ylist = ylist,
        countslist = NULL,
        X = X,
        numclust = 4,
        maxdev = 0.5)
```

The above call to `one_job()` saves one file to `1-1-1-1-cvscore.Rdata` to
`destin = "~/Desktop"`.

Next, the `nrep` estimated models for any given `ialpha` and `ibeta` --
estimated in the full data -- are obtained using `one_job_refit()` (again,
saving to files named `[ialpha]-[ibeta]-[irep]-cvscore.Rdata`):

```{r one-job-refit, eval=FALSE}
## Example of one replicate of model estimation (in the full data) for one pair
## of regularization parameters.
ialpha = 1
ibeta = 1
irep = 1
destin = "~/Desktop"## Change to your target destination.
one_job_refit(ialpha = ialpha,
              ibeta = ibeta,
              irep = irep,
              destin = destin,
              mean_lambda = mean_lambdas, prob_lambdas = prob_lambdas,
              ## The rest that is needed explicitly for flowmix()
              ylist = ylist,
              countslist = NULL,
              X = X,
              numclust = 4,
              maxdev = 0.5,
              )
```

It's recommended to use multiple computers or servers for the full
cross-validation, e.g. using `parallel::mclapply()`.
