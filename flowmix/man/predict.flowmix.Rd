\title{Prediction: Given new covariates X's, generate a set of predicted cluster
means and probs (and return the same Sigma).}
\usage{
\method{predict}{flowmix}(object, logits = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{Object returned from \code{flowmix()}.}

\item{logits}{Logical: should the function return the logits of the cluster probs (TRUE)
or the cluster probs (FALSE)?}

\item{...}{Make sure to provide new covariate values, a row vector in the
same format and column names as the original X used in \code{object}, in
\code{newx}.}
}
\value{
List containing mean, prob, and sigma. If 
user specifies logits = TRUE, prob will still be 
called prob, but it will actually contain the linear 
predictor of prob (the multinomial analogue of the 
logit function).
}
